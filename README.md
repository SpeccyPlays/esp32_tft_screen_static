# esp32_tft_screen_static
Uses an ST7735 TFT screen with ESP32-WROOM to display UK TV test card F in black and white then run a fake bar of static down the screen
It's been updated to non blocking code so multiple bars can be created and shown.
A full screen of static can be repeated on a timer, and it can repeat how many times you would like - this looks better than showing a full screen of static before flipping to the background
